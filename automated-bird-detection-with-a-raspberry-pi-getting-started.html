      <p>I read about a Raspberry Pi implementation of <a href="https://birdnet.cornell.edu/">BirdNET</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and immediately wanted one for our garden.</p>
	  <p>BirdNET is a neural net algorithm trained to identity bird species. I worked on a spectacuarly unsuccessful neural network as part of my degree, and so am always keen to find one that actually works.</p>
	  <p>I love this software! Everybody's life would be enhanced with one of these running, so I've decided to write up my experience in three parts:</p>
	  <ul class="square">
	    <li>Part 1 - Getting started (below)</li>
		<li><a href="automated-bird-detection-with-a-raspberry-pi-configuring-and-upgrading.html">Part 2 - Configuring and upgrading</a></li> 
		<li>Part 3 - What comes next?</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>Kit</h2>
	  <p><a href="https://birdnetpi.com/">BirdNET-Pi</a> is a fantastic implementation of BirdNET for the Raspberry Pi by <href="https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi">Patrick McGuire</a>. It wraps the neural net inside an application that records, analyses and presents back the results 24/7, all in a nice web UI.</p>
	  <p>It will run on a Pi 4B, Pi 3B+, or a Raspberry Pi 0W2 so long as they are running the 64bit Lite version of Pi OS.</p>
	  <p>My first problem was finding a Raspberry Pi - I've never used one before directly, but given their cheap cost and easy availability there was a low barrier to entry... right? Wrong. Availability is massively constrained across all models; I ordered one online but my retailer gave an updated delivery date of Q1 2023. eBay came to the rescue and I acquired a Zero 2W for a reasonable mark-up.</p>
	  <p>Along with an official power supply and an existing micro SD card, I needed a way to collect the sound. Some research let to a UGreen USB sound card, and a AGPTEK lavalier microphone. The Pi and sound card are mounted internally:</p>
	  <p><img src="images/birdnet-pi-internal.jpg"  class="postimg" alt="Raspberry Pi and soundcard mounted internally"></p>
	  <p>And the microphone then runs externally via the rubber window seal to sit protected under the eaves and over the garden. It came with a handy fur cover to minimise wind noise:</p>

	  <h2>Installing BirdNET-Pi</h2>
	  <p>Flashing the micro-Sd card with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/">Pi OS Lite 64-bit</a> was dead easy, but I wanted to be able to administer the Pi remotely without needing a mouse/keyboard.</p>
	  <p>This needed a bit of jiggery-pokery to ensure that wifi and SSH were enabled - here's a <a href<a href="https://linuxhint.com/rasperberry_pi_wifi_wpa_supplicant/">neat method</a> thay involves dropping two simple text files onto the SD card. I then used the Android app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh&hl=en_GB&gl=US">JuiceSSHM</a> to run commands remotely without needing to plug in a mouse/keyboard. All very clever.</p>
	  <p>This allowed me to trigger the install and initial boot of BirdNET-Pi. On the Zero 2 W this took quite a while, and once running it was clearly pretty slow. I'd neglected to read Patrick's comments that explained while theoretically functional, the Zero 2 W really isn't capable of being responsive while running all the apps. See <a href="automated-bird-detection-with-a-raspberry-pi-configuring-and-upgrading.html">part 2</a> for my upgrade path.</p>
